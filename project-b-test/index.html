        <p class="content">Avicii, a music producer from Finland, is my favourite music artist of all time. When I faced difficulties, his song would always cheer me up. And in a music video he made, he said a sentence that impressed me a lot: He had a dream that everyone has the accessibility to music producing, and that everyone can turn his brilliant idea from mind to mp3. This is what inspired me to make this melody maker, which is able to complete a song along with the beats.</p>

          <p class="content">FL Studio is a tool of music producing. As you can see in the background, this is the UI of FL Studio, and it is very convenient to use. It is also the tool Avicii used to make songs, and it is also the tool that I use to make the processed notes. You would find out what is a 'processed note' in the project.</p>

          <p class="content">Another inspiration is Chrome Music Lab. In this website, there are many different projects about making music, and one of them is just called melody maker. But it only contains very simple functions, just designing a loop and playing it out. What I would like to realize is, with just a click on the note, the chord, the melody, and even the beats will be generated and played. With this function, people would be able to design their own melodies and enjoy their work.</p>
